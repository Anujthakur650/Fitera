## ðŸ§® Advanced Calculations

### Muscle Group Balance
```javascript
// Balance calculation
const totalVolume = allGroups.reduce(sum of volume)
const percentage = (groupVolume / totalVolume) * 100
const avgPercentage = 100 / numberOfGroups
const deviation = Math.abs(percentage - avgPercentage)

// Imbalance detection
if (deviation > 15%) {
  status = deviation > 25% ? 'high' : 'moderate'
}
```

### Strength Ratios
```javascript
// 1RM Estimation (Epley Formula)
estimatedOneRM = weight * (1 + reps / 30)

// Ratio Analysis
actualRatio = primaryMax / secondaryMax
deviation = Math.abs(actualRatio - idealRatio)
deviationPercent = (deviation / idealRatio) * 100
```

### Progression Trends
```javascript
// Linear regression for trend analysis
slope = (n * sumXY - sumX * sumY) / (n * sumXX - sumX * sumX)
percentChange = ((last - first) / first) * 100

// Consistency score
cv = standardDeviation / mean
consistencyScore = Math.max(0, 100 * (1 - cv))
```

### Overall Fitness Score
```javascript
// Weighted scoring system
muscleBalanceScore = imbalances.length === 0 ? 25 : points based on severity
strengthRatioScore = based on overall balance rating
consistencyScore = frequency consistency * 0.25
frequencyScore = optimal range (3-5 workouts/week) = 25 points

totalScore = (sum of component scores / 100) * 100
```
